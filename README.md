# Graphs
Code structure detection graph tool.

This library can be used for detection of ifs, loops, gotos and other structures inside directed graphs.

## Dot Graphs
The library accepts Graphviz dot source as input.

## GUI tool
The library comes with GUI tool for editing and displaying dot graphs
and buttons for execution of the structure detection algorithm.

## Dot executable needed
To draw graphs on screen, you need dot executable. (`dot.exe` on windows)
The executable is bundled with GraphViz installation.

## Sample graphs
In the directory [graphs/](graphs/), sample graphs are placed.
These samples can be edited and organized directly in the UI.

## Work in progress
**Considere it as not finished**. The idea is to use the detection in the [JPEXS decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) in the future releases.
